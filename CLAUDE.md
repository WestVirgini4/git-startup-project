# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a simple HTML-based project containing a single static web page. The repository contains:
- `index.html`: A basic HTML page with inline CSS styling displaying "Hello world!" with a button

## Architecture

This is a minimal static HTML project with no build system, dependencies, or framework. The entire application consists of:
- A single HTML file with embedded CSS and a simple user interface
- No JavaScript functionality currently implemented
- No package management or build tools configured

## Development Workflow

Since this is a static HTML project, development is straightforward:
- Edit `index.html` directly for any changes
- Open the file in a web browser to test changes
- No compilation, build, or bundling steps required

## Repository Structure

```
.
├── .git/           # Git repository metadata
└── index.html      # Main HTML page
```

This is a git repository tracking a single HTML file. The project appears to be in a clean state with all changes committed.
